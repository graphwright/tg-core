    This is a *derivable* predicate, not an extracted one: it is produced by

    It therefore subclasses ``BaseStatement`` directly rather than
    ``StoryStatement`` -- an inferred fact has no story-extraction metadata
    (no ``story_id``, paragraph index, or extraction confidence), and requiring
    those fields would make it impossible for the datalog engine to construct a
    derived head. Keeping extracted and inferred predicates on separate branches
    of the hierarchy is the honest ontology: provenance-of-extraction belongs
    only to things that were extracted.
